* Soft robots are primarily composed of easily deformable matter such as fluids, gels, and elastomers that match the elastic and rheological properties of biological tissue and organs. Like an octopus squeezing through a narrow opening or a caterpillar rolling through uneven terrain, a soft robot must adapt its shape and locomotion strategy for a broad range of tasks, obstacles, and environmental conditions. This emerging class of elastically soft, versatile, and biologically inspired machines represents an exciting and highly interdisciplinary paradigm in engineering that could revolutionize the role of robotics in healthcare, field exploration, and cooperative human assistance.
* Most suitable for environments and applications that require interaction with soft materials and organisms and/or artificial replication of biological functions.

* Compliance Matching
    * To prevent injury or robot immobility, the surface e of soft robots must be adequately soft and deformable in order to distribute forces over a large contact area and eliminate interfacial stress concentrations.
    * Compliance matching is particularly important in the subdomain of wearable technologies for human motor assistance.
* Potential Applications
    * Soft wearables for human motor assistance.
    * Biologically inspired field robots for autonomous exploration.

    * At the scales of invertebrates, insects and microorganisms, may also eventually be used for drug delivery, minimally invasive surgery, and medical implants.   
    * It is unlikely that they would be useful for heavy-duty industrial applications.
* Beyond Robotics
    * As the field of soft robotics grows, the supporting softmatter technologies used in sensing, electronics, and actuation will continue to mature and will eventually appear in application domains.
    * Strechable microelectronics.
