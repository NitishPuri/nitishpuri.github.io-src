## Bio Robots

### <a name="openratslam"> </a> OpenRatSLAM : an open source brain-based SLAM system   
*Feb 2013*   
[*Source*](http://static.springer.com/sgw/documents/1388513/application/pdf/10-3.pdf)    

* *RatSLAM, OpenRatSLAM, SLAM, Navigation, Mapping, Brain-based, Appearance-based, ROS, Open-source, Hippocampus*
* RatSLAM is a navigation system based on the neural processes underlying navigation in the rodent brain, capable of operating with low resolution monocular image data. This paper describes OpenRatSLAM, an open source version of RatSLAM with bindings to ROS   
* SLAM(Simultaneous Localization and Mapping) , at the core based on SIFT or SURF features.
* This implementation is based on RatSLAM, leveraging tools like OpenCV and ROS. 
* Modular, detailed, integrated with ROS and *rviz*, works online and offline.

    * *Pose Cells, Local View Cells and Experience Map*
* OpenRatSLAM, [code](https://code.google.com/archive/p/ratslam)
    * ![alt](/images/papers/ratSlam2.jpg)
    * Pose Cell Network : represents pose in response to odometric and local view connections. This also makes decisions about the experience map node and link creation.
    * Local View Cells : determines whether a scene is novel or familiar by image comparison techniques. Mostly based on template matching.
    * Experience map : manages graph building, graph relaxation and path planning.
    * Visual Odometry : For image only datasets, provides an odometric estimate based on changes in the visual scene. 
* OpenRatSLAM parameters and tuning
    * ![alt](/images/papers/ratSlam3.jpg) ![alt](/images/papers/ratSlam4.jpg)
    * Iterative tuning by minimizing loss.
* Using OpenRatSLAM
    * Examples of datasets this is used with, and some results.
* Future work

* Big gap between fantasy and reality in terms of Autonomous Robots.
* Inspirations from *insects* : agility, adaptability, simplicity
* Focuses on *walking* like an insect.
* From Biology to Robotics
    * Studies done at various levels of integration and inspiration.
* Distributed Gait Control
* A Distributed Neural Network Controller
    * ![alt](/images/papers/bioRobots1.jpg)
