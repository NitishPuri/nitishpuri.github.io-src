## Image Segmentation

### Image segmentation review
[*Source*](http://blog.qure.ai/notes/semantic-segmentation-deep-learning-review)   

* A review of segmentation at qure.ai  

### Rich feature hierarchies for accurate object detection and semantic segmentation   
*Ross Girshick, Jeff Donahue, Trevor Darrell, Jitendra Malik : Oct 2014*   
[*Source*](https://arxiv.org/abs/1311.2524)   

* Introduces R-CNN, Regions with CNN. Bridging the gap between image classification and object detection.

* **Object detection with R-CNN**
* *Region proposals.* Uses [selective search](https://ivi.fnwi.uva.nl/isis/publications/bibtexbrowser.php?key=UijlingsIJCV2013&bib=all.bib).
* Propose a bunch of boxes in the image and see if any of them actually correspond to an object.
* **Feature extraction.** Extracts a 4096 dimensional feature vector from each region proposal by propagating a mean subtracted *227 X 227 RGB* image through five conv layers and two fully connected layers.
* These test time detections are highly parallel and the costs can amortized costs are hence low.
* Training is done by *supervised pre-training* followed by *domain-specific fine-tuning*
* Finally, R-CNN runs a simpler linear regression on the region proposal to generate tighter bounding box coordinates to get our final results.

### Fast R-CNN
*Ross Girshick : Sep 2015*   
[*Source*](https://arxiv.org/abs/1504.08083)   
[*Implementation*](https://github.com/rbgirshick/fast-rcnn)

* *9 X* faster at training time. *213 X* faster at test time.
* Streamline the previous process by jointly learning to classify object proposals and refine their spatial locations.
* Advantages:
    * Higher detection quality than R-CNN and SPPnet.
    * Training is single stage, using a multi-task loss.
    * Training can update all network layers.
    * No disk storage is required for feature caching.
* **Architecture**
![alt](/images/papers/fastRcnn1.jpg)
* The RoI pooling layer : Run the CNN just once per image and then find a way to share that computation across the ~2000 proposals.

* Initializing from pre-trained networks. with some modifications.
* Fine tuning for detection.
    * Hierarchical sampling.
    * Multi-task loss. Classification loss + boounding box regression offsets.
    * Mini-batch Sampling.
    * Back-propagation through RoI pooling layers.
    * SGD hyperparameters.


### Faster R-CNN: Towards Real-Time Object Detection with Region Proposal Networks   
*Shaoqing Ren, Kaiming He, Ross Girshick, Jian Sun : Jan 2016*   
*Microsoft Research*   
[*Source*](https://arxiv.org/abs/1506.01497)   
[*Implementation*](https://github.com/rbgirshick/py-faster-rcnn)   

* Eliminating the bottleneck, region proposals as inputs.
* Introduces *Region Proposal Networks* (RPNs) that share convolutional layers with object detection networks.

* While training we alternate between the region proposal task and object detection task while keeping the proposals fixed.

### Mask R-CNN   
*Kaiming He, Georgia Gkioxari, Piotr Doll√°r, Ross Girshick : Apr 2017*   
*Facebook AI Research*   
[*Source*](https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.06870)   
[*Implementation*](https://github.com/CharlesShang/FastMaskRCNN)   

![alt](/images/papers/maskRcnn1.jpg)   

* Extends Faster R-CNN by adding another branch that predicts the object mask along with the bounding boxes.   
![alt](/images/papers/maskRcnn1.jpg)   
* Faster R-CNN does not provide pixel-to-pixel alignment between network inputs and outputs.
* To fix this a layer *RoIAlign* is proposed which replaces *RoIPool* layer used previously.   
* The first stage is identical to Faster R-CNN.
* In the second stage, along with predicting the class and the box offset, Mask R-CNN also outputs a binary mask for each RoI.
* Multi-task loss is used : $L = L_{cls} + L_{bbox} + L_{mask}$.
* Masks are generated for every class without competition among classes. This *decouples* mask and class prediction.
* Different architectures are used as  convolutional *backbone*, ResNet and ResNeXt

### A Review of Deep Learning Techniques Applied to Semantic Segmentation   
*Alberto Garcia-Garcia, Sergio Orts-Escolano, Sergiu Oprea, Victor Villena-Martinez, Jose Garcia-Rodriguez : Apr 2017*
[*Source*](https://arxiv.org/abs/1704.06857)   

* *Semantic Segmentation, Deep Learning, Scene Labeling, Object Segmentation*   
* This paper provides a review on deep learning methods for semantic segmentation applied to various  application areas. This also describes the terminology used as well as some background concepts, then some existing models are reviewed(2017). At last a set of promising future works are discussed.
* These techniques are not very mature as of yet, mainly because of a lack of unifying picture.
![Evolution of object recognition](/images/papers/deepSegment1.jpg)
* CNN Architectures : AlexNet, VGG, GoogleNet, ResNet, etc..
* 2D and 3D Datasets : [PascalVOC](http://host.robots.ox.ac.uk/pascal/VOC/voc2012/),  [Microsoft COCO](6. http://mscoco.org/), and more,...   
* Decoder Variants, Integrating Context Knowledge
* Instance Segmentation
* RGB-D Data and 3D Data
* Video Sequences   

### DeepLab : Semantic Image Segmentation with Deep Convolution Nets, Atrous Convolution, and Fully Connected CRFs   
*Liang-Chieh Chen, George Papandreou, Iasonas Kokkinos, Kevin Murphy, Alan L. Yuille : May 2017*   
[*Source*](https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.00915)    

* *Semantic Segmentation, Atrous Convolution, Conditional Random Fields*
* Introduces upsampled filters(Altrous Convolution) as a tool in dense prediction tasks. Allows us to control the resolution at which feature responses are computed and also allows us to effectively enlarge the field of view of filters to incorporate larger context without increasing the number of parameters or the amount of computation.
