## **Deep Learning**

### **Architectures**

#### **Self-Normalizing Neural Networks**

* Deep learning is setting new benchmarks everyday with the help of RNNs and CNNs.
* However, looking at problems that are not related to vision or sequential tasks, gradient boosting, random forests, or support vector machines are winning most of the competitions(Eg. Kaggle, [HIGGS Challenge](https://www.kaggle.com/c/higgs-boson)).
* With CNNs success, batch normalization and other stochastic regularization techniques has evolved into a standard.
* Both RNNs and CNNs can stabilize learning with weight sharing.
* However, this is not very useful with FNNs, and often leads to high variance.
* **Self-Normalizing Neural Networks**
* **Definition 1 :** *A neural network is self-normalizing if it possesses a mapping $g : \Omega \mapsto\Omega$ for each activation $y$ that maps mean and variance from one layer to the next and has a stable and attracting fixed point depending on $(\omega,\tau)$ in $\Omega$. Furthermore, the mean and the variance remain in the domain $\Omega$, that is $g(\Omega)\subseteq\Omega$, where $\Omega = \{(\mu,\nu)|\mu\in[\mu_{min}, \mu{max}], \nu\in[\nu_{min}, \nu{max}]\}$. When iteratively applying the mapping $g$, each point within $\Omega$ converges to this fixed point.*
* So, SNNs keep normalization of activations when propagating them through layers of the network.
* **Constructing SNNs :** 
    * The activation function, SELU
$$\text{selu}(x) = \lambda\begin{cases}x, & \text{if } x \ge 0 \\
\alpha e^x - \alpha, & \text{if } x \leq 0 \end{cases}$$
    * This activation allows to construct a mapping $g$ with properties that lead to SNNs. They cannot be derived with (scaled) ReLUs, sigmoid units, $tanh$ units and leaky ReLUs.
    * For weight initialization $\omega=0$ and $\tau=1$ for all units in higher layer is proposed.

* New Dropout techniques are introduced.
* Benchmarks compared for UCI repository datasets, outperforming FNNs with and without normalization techniques, such as batch, layer and weight normalization or specialized architectures such as ResNets.
* Also proved that SNNs do not face vanishing and exploding gradients problem and therefore work well for architectures with many layers.
* The best performaing SNNs are typically very deep in contrast to other FNNs.

#### **Understanding deep learning requires rethinking generalization**

* Neural networks have far more often trainable parameters than the number of samples they are trained on. Even then they exhibit small *generalization errorr* i.e. difference between "training error" and "test error".
* **Effective Capacity Of Neural Networks**
    * **Randomization tests.** Standard architectures were trained on a copy of data where the true labels were replaced by random labels. 
    * *Deep neural networks easily fit random labels* i.e. the they achieve 2 test error.
    * The test error was of course no better than random chance as there was no correlation between the training and test labels.
    * Also replacing the true images with random pixels(Gaussian noise), we observe that CNNs continue to fit the data with zero training error.

    * This has the following implications:
        * The effective capacity of neural networks is sufficient for memorizing the entire dataset.
        * Even optimization on random labels remains easy. In fact, training time increases only by a small constant factor compared with training on the true labels.
        * Randomizing the labels is solely a data transformation, leaving all other properties of the learning problem unchanged.
* **The role of regularization**
* *Explicit regularization may improve generalization performance, but is neither necessary not by itself sufficient for controlling generalization error.*
* $l_2$ regularization sometimes even helps optimization, illustrating its poorly understoof nature in deep learning.
![alt](/images/papers/nnGeneralization2.jpg)   
* **Finite sample expressivity**
* **Theorem 1.** *There exists a two-layer neural network with ReLU activations and $2n+d$ weights that can represent any function on a sample of size $n$ in $d$ dimensions.*   
* **Implicit Regularization : An Appeal To Linear Models**
* Arguments showing that it is not necessarily easy to understand the source of generalization for linear models either.
* Do all global minima generalize equally well? Is there a way to determine when one global minimum will generalize whereas another will not? In case of a linear model, even the curvature of the loss function would be the same.
