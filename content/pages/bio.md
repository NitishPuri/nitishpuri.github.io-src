A self motivated and passionate engineer who is interested in computer graphics, simulations, machine intelligence, computer vision and everything in between.   

On the other side I am very much into video games(all kind), music(all kind), visual art(all kind)
and (philosophy of)sciences(almost all kind).   

I had a very boring start when I joined Bachelors in Mechanical, IIT Roorkee. Although it is an
awesome place, I found out that my passions don't lie in the gear box, (or the machining lab for that 
matter). Pretty soon I found myself consuming lots of games and music. Started playing with some game 
engines and created a very basic **3D Flight Simulator**. And that was all I did in my time there(apart 
from the other things that engineering students do).    

Fortunately, I got hired at **VizExperts India**, an information visualization company with roots in
desktop graphics. That was the time when I realized how cool programming can be!!! From there on, it has
been quite a journey. We primarily worked on our in-house 3D GIS based planning and simulation engine
built on an open source renderer, OpenSceneGraph which has been called with different names since then, 
we will just call it **GeorbIS**. I worked on everything from frontend UI framework to rendering and 
simulation engine to 3D computational filters. It really brought back all the lost love i had for 
classical physics in the form of Matrix transformations.Did a lot of 
app level features with direct involvement with the clients.   
I also had a small role in **VizSim** platform, a distributed simulation engine that provides real time sensor data fusion and visualization. There I got introduced to OpenCV and computer vision in general and implemented my first object detection and tracking pipeline. It was very cool.   

After that, we started working on **VizGame**, a gamified training platform built on top of **Unreal Engine**. It used our GeorbIS framework as a data backend for creating procedurally populated, highly realistic terrains with GIS data. Here, again, my role went from laying out the Game design to implementing multiplayer(Co-presence) in VR. And by this time I was also involved in mentoring other people who were like me a few years back. 

In the mean time I was getting more and more interested towards data science and machine intelligence.
So, I decided to pursue my interests with self learning, with a vision of somehow managing to merge my experience with computer graphics and simulation to the field of computer vision and robotics.

Lets see how far we can get.!!!!
