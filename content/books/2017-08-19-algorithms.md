## Chapter 0: Prologue
- Books and algorithms
    - Ideas that changed the world.
    - Widespread use of decimal system.
- Enter Fibonacci
    - `0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, ....,`
    - Also, $F_n = F_{n-1} + F_{n-2}$
    - And, $F_n ≈ 2^{0.694n}$
    - A naive implementation , with no caching of values.., `fib1`
        - Runtime --> $T(n) >= F_n$, exponential in n
    - Can We Do Better,....?
    - A Polynomial algorithm..., `fib2`
        - A loop based algorithm that remembers previous values in an array.
        - Polynomial running time.
    - More Careful Analysis
        - What about addition of numbers Fibonacci values for large n.
        - Adding two n-bit integers take time ~ n.
        - So, $fib1 ≈  n.Fn$
        - And, $fib2 ≈ n^2$
- **Big-O** notation
    - Right simplification of the analysis.
    - Leave behind the lower order terms.
    - General rules :
        - Multiplicative constants can be omitted.
        - $n^a$ dominates $n^b, if a > b$
        - Any exponential dominates any polynomial. $a^n$ dominates  $n^b$
        - Likewise, any polynomial dominates any logarithm. $n$ dominates $log(n)$
- Exercise 0.4

    - So now $F_n$ can be computed by calculating $X^n$ where $X$ is the square matrix.
    - So, $Fn = O(log n)$
    - But then, with careful analysis,
        - Multiplication of large n-bit numbers $≈ O(n^2)$

## Chapter 1: Algorithms with Numbers
Two ancient problems:   
    **Factoring** : Given a number N, express it as a product of its prime factors. *Hard*   
    **Primality** : Given a number N, determine whether it is a prime. *Easy*   
### Basic Arithmetic   
![alt](/images/algdg/1_base.png)   

- *Addition*   
The sum of any three single-digit numbers is at most two digits long.   
Given two binary numbers x and y, how does our algorithm take to add them?   
Depends on size of input, number of bits in x and y.   
Running time $= O(n), n =$ number of bits in the numbers.   
Is there anything faster? No..   
About word length and large numbers
- **Multiplication and Division**   
To multiply `x` and `y`, create an array of intermediate sums, each representing the product of `x` by a single digit if `y`. These values are appropriately left shifted and added up.   
    - Running time = Addition of n numbers of n-bits length
                   = $(n-1).O(n)$
                   = $O(n^2)$   

    - Another fascinating algorithm for multiplication:   
    ![alt](/images/algdg/1_mult.png)
    ![alt](/images/algdg/1_mult2.png)   
    However, running time = $O(n^2)$ , n = number of bits.   
    ![alt](/images/algdg/1_div.png)   

### Modular Arithmetic   
$$x \equiv y \pmod N  \Leftrightarrow  N divides (x - y)$$   

- Modular arithmetic is a system for dealing with restricted ranges of integers.   
- Another interpretation is that modular arithmetic deals with all the integers, but divides into N equivalence classes, each of the form $\{i+kN:k\in \mathbb Z\},  i \in [0, N-1]$.   
    ![alt](/images/algdg/1_subs.png)   
    ![alt](/images/algdg/1_comp.png)   

- **Modular addition and multiplication**   
    To `add` two numbers *x* and *y* modulo *N*, we start with regular addition. Since *x* and *y* are both in the range *0* to *N - 1*, their sum is in the range *0* to *2(N-1)*. If the sum exceeds *N-1*, we merely need to subtract off *N* to bring it back to required range. So, running time $= O(n), n = log N$.  

    To `multiply` two mod N numbers x and y, do regular multiplication, reduce the answer to modulo N. The product can be as large as $(N-1)^2$, at most 2n bits large. Need to compute the remainder using quadratic time division algorithm. Multiplication thus remains quadratic.   

    `Division`, however is tricky, whenever legal, it can be managed in quadratic time.   

- **Modular exponentiation**   
    We want to compute $x^y \pmod N$.   
![alt](/images/algdg/1_modex.png)   
    Let *n* be the size(bits) of *x, y and N*. As with multiplication, the algorithm will halt after at most *n* recursive calls, and during each call it multiplies n-bit numbers, for a total running time of $O(n^3)$.   

- **Euclid's algorithm for G.C.D**   
![alt](/images/algdg/1_gcd.png)   
**Eculid's rule :** If x and y are positive integers with $x >= y$ , then $gcd(x, y) = gcd(x \pmod y, y)$.   
Also, if $a > b$, then $a \pmod b < a/2$.   
This means after any two consecutive iterations, both arguments are at the very least reduced to half.If they are initially n-bit, base case will be reached in at most *2n* recursive calls. And each call involves a quadratic-time division. Running time $= O(n^3)$.   

- **An extension to Euclid's algorithm**
    A small extension to Euclid's algorithm is the key to dividing in the modular world.    
    ![alt](/images/algdg/1_gcd2.png)   
- **Modular division**   
*x* is the *multiplicative inverse* of *a modulo N*, if $ax == 1 \pmod N$      
If $gcd(a,N) > 1 , \Rightarrow ax \neq 1 \pmod N  \forall x$, and therefor *a* cannot have a multiplicative inverse *modulo N*.   
When $gcd(a, N) = 1$, we say *a* and *N* are *relatively prime*.   
The extended Euclid's algorithm gives us integers *x* and *y* such that $ax + Ny = 1$, which means $ax \equiv 1 (mod N)$ . Thus x is a's sought *inverse*.   

**Modular Division Theorem** , `a` has multiplicative inverse modulo `N`, if and only if they are relatively prime, and it can be found by running extended Euclid theorem in time $O(n^3)$.

- **Primality Testing**   
![alt](/images/algdg/1_fermat.png)   
![alt](/images/algdg/1_isprime2.png)   
Here the theorem does not say anything about what happens if number is not prime.   
In fact, for some composite numbers, *Pr(Algorithm returns yes when N is not prime) <= 1/2*
We can thus choose *k* different random integers to test for primality testing, reducing Pr to $1/2^k$.   
    - **Generating random primes**   
        ![alt](/images/algdg/1_lgprime.png)   
        Due to such abundance of prime numbers, prime number generation is easy.   
        - Generate a random n-bit number.
        - Check for primality.
        - If not prime, repeat the process.   

### Cryptography
*Rivest-Shamir-Adelman(RSA)* : Blabber about private key and public key systems.   

- *Private-key schemes: one time pad and AES*   
- *RSA*   
Public key cryptography   
Based heavily upon number theory.

### Universal Hashing   
- **Hash Tables**
Give a `key` to any `value`.   
*Hash function :* How to define the mapping between `key` and `value`.   
- **Families of Hash Functions**

A family of hash functions with this property is called *universal* .
