}
```
* The Game Loop
    * Many interacting subsystems.
    * Each subsystem may work at a different refresh rate and synchronize with each other.
    * A Simple Example : *Pong*
```c
void main() // Pong 
{
    initGame();
    while(true) {   // game loop
        readHumanInterfaceDevices();
        if(quitButtonPressed) {
            break;  // break out of the game loop
        }
        movePaddles();
        moveBall();
        collideAndBounceBall();
        if(ballImpactSide(LEFT_PLAYER)) {
            incrementScore(RIGHT_PLAYER);
            resetBall();
        }
        else if(ballImpactSide(RIGHT_PLAYER)) {
            incrementScore(LEFT_PLAYER);
            resetBall();
        }

        renderPlayField();
    }
}
```

```C++      
// The Framework!!
while(true) {
    foreach(frameListener) {
        frameListener.frameStarted();
    }
    renderCurrentScene();
    foreach(frameListener) {
        frameListener.frameEnded();
    }
    finalizeSceneAndSwapBuffers();
}
```
```C++
// A frame listener implementation
class GameFrameListener : public FrameListener 
{
public:
    virtual void frameStarted() {
        // Things that must happen before rendering
        pollInputDevices();
        updatePlayerControls();
        updateDynamics();
        resolveCollisions();
        updateCamera();
        // etc.
    }
    virtual void frameEnded() {
        // Things to do after scene rendering
        drawHud();
        // etc.
    }
}
```
