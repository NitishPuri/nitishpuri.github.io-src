## Chapter 2: Divide-and-Conquer Algorithms
The divide and conquer strategy solves a problem by   
1. Breaking it into sub-problems that are themselves smaller instances of the same type of problem.   
2. Recursively solving these problems.   
3. Appropriately combining their results.   

### Multiplication   
For multiplying two n-bit integers x and y.   
$x = \bbox[5px, border:2px solid black]{ x_L } \quad \bbox[5px, border:2px solid black]{ x_R } = 2^{n/2}x_L + x_R$   
$y = \bbox[5px, border:2px solid black]{ y_L } \quad \bbox[5px, border:2px solid black]{ y_R } = 2^{n/2}y_L + y_R$   

then, 
$xy = (2^{n/2}x_L + x_R)(2^{n/2}y_L + y_R) = 2^nx_Ly_L + 2^{n/2}(x_Ly_R + x_Ry_L) + x_Ry_R$

Now, we can compute xy by evaluating the RHS. Addition and multiplication by $2^n$ are linear time. Rest of the 4 multiplications can be done by recursively applying this algorithm.   

So, $T(n) = 4T(n/2) + O(n)$.

Which results in $O(n^2)$.

By expanding the middle term, we can do with just three calculations, $x_Ly_L , x_Ry_R, (x_L+x_R)(y_L+y_R)$.   
since,   
$x_Ly_R  + x_Ry_L =  (x_L + x_R ) (y_L + y_R )  - x_Ly_L – x_Ry_R$.   

Resulting algorithm would then be   
$T(n) = 3T(n/2) + O(n)$, which is $O(n^{1.59})$

Height of the tree $= \log_2 n$, since the length of the sub-problem gets halved at every level.   
Branching factor = 3.   

So, at any level k we will have $3^k$  to solve each of size $n/2^k$.   

Therefore, time spent at level k is, $3^k \times O(\frac n {2^k}) = (\frac 3 2)^k \times O(n)$   

Which is a geometric series. So, the sum then approximates to the last term of the series.   
That is $O(3^{\log_2 n})$, which can be written as $O(n^{\log_2 3})$, which is about $O(n^{1.59})$.   

Can we do better ??? using *Fast Fourier Transforms* discussed later.

### Recurrence relations

Consider this recurrence tree.   
![alt](/images/algdg/2_recur.png)   

**Master's Theorem :**  
If $T(n) = aT(\lceil n/b \rceil) + O(n^d)$ for some constants $a > 0, b > 1$, and $d \ge 0$, then   

$$ T(n) = \begin{cases}
 O(n^d), \text{ if } d > \log_b a \\ 
 O(n^d\log n), \text{ if } d = \log_b a \\
 O(n^{\log_b a}), \text{ if } d < \log_b a 
 \end{cases}$$

### Mergesort
Sort an array by recursively sorting each half and merging the results.   
![alt](/images/algdg/2_merge.png)   

![alt](/images/algdg/2_merge2.png)   

Since merge does constant amount of work per recursive call, overall time is   
$$ T(n) = 2T(n/2) + O(n), \text{   or  } O(n\log n)$$   
Here is an iterative version using a Queue.

### Medians
Median = 50th percentile of a list of numbers.   
![alt](/images/algdg/2_medians.png)   
*A randomized divide-and-conquer algorithm for selection*   
For any number `v`, Split `S` into three categories: elements smaller than `v` $(S_L)$, equal to `v` $(S_v)$ , greater than `v` $(S_R)$ , then
$$ selection(S, k) = \begin{cases}
 selection(S_L, k), \quad\quad\quad\quad\quad\quad \text{if } k \le |S_L| \\ 
 v , \quad\quad\quad\quad\quad\quad\quad\quad\quad\quad\quad\quad \text{  if } |S_L| < k \le |S_L| + |S_v| \\
 selection(S_R, k - |S_L| - |S_v|), \text{ if } k > |S_L| + |S_v| 
 \end{cases}$$   

The three sub-lists can be computed in linear time, even in place.    
How to pick `v` ? Randomly from `S`.

### Matrix multiplication   
![alt](/images/algdg/2_matmul.png)   
Symbolically,   
$$ Z_{ij} = \sum_{k=1}^n X_{ik}Y_{kj}$$

This implies the algorithm to be $O(n^3)$

Enter divide-and-conquer.   
Divide the matrices X and Y into 4 blocks.   
$$ X = \begin{bmatrix} A & B \\ C & D \end{bmatrix}, Y = \begin{bmatrix}E & F \\ G & H\end{bmatrix} 
$$,    

Then, their product can be expressed as,   
$$ XY = \begin{bmatrix}A & B \\ C & D\end{bmatrix} = 
\begin{bmatrix}AE+BG & AF+BH \\ CE+DG & CF+DH \end{bmatrix} $$   

Total running time can be described as,   
$T(n) = 8T(n/2) + O(n^2), \text{ which is again } O(n^3)$.

Turns out you can do this,  
$$ XY = \begin{bmatrix}P_5+P_4-P_2+P_6 & P_1+P_2 \\ P_3+P_4 & P_1+P_5-P_3-P_7\end{bmatrix} $$   

where,   
$P_1 = A(F-H) \quad\quad P_5 = (A+D)(E+H)$   
$P_2 = (A+B)H \quad\quad P_6 = (B-D)(G+H)$   
$P_3 = (C+D)E \quad\quad P_7 = (A-C)(E+F)$   
$P_4 = D(G-E)$   

The new running time is, $T(n) = 7T(n/2) + O(n^2), \text{which is } O(n^{\log_2 7}) \approx O(n^{2.81})$   

### Fast Fourier transform

Next target, *Polynomials*.

The general solution for polynomial multiplication works in $\theta(d^2)$ time, where $d$ is the degree of polynomials.

*An alternative representation of polynomials.*

**Fact** : *A degree-d polynomial is uniquely characterized by its values at any $d+1$ distinct points*.   

So, we can specify a degree-d polynomial $$A(x) = a_0+a_1x+...+a_dx^d$$ by any one of the following,   
1. Its coefficients, $a_0, a_1,..., a_d$   
2. The values $A(x_0), A(x_1), ..., A(x_d)$   

Now, taking in consideration the second form, the product has a degree $2d$, and is completely determined by its values at $2d+1$ points.   
Since, those values are just products of the two polynomials at the given point. Thus, polynomial multiplication takes linear time in the value representation.

*Evaluation by divide-and-conquer*   
**The Trick** : Choose the n points to be selected as positive-negative pairs, then the computations needed to be done overlap a lot.   
Specifically,   
![alt](/images/algdg/2_eval.png)   
if we could then recurse, we would have,   
$$T(n) = 2T(n/2) + O(n), \text{which is } O(n\log n)$$   
But, recursing it at the second level and beyond seems impossible. Unless, of-course we use complex numbers.   
To get positive-negative pairs at subsequent levels, we can use the roots of $z^n = 1$   
Which are, $1, \omega, \omega^2, ... \omega^{n-1}, \text{ where, } \omega = e^{2\pi i/n}$   

So, if we choose these numbers, at every successive level of recursion we have pairs of positive-negative numbers   
![alt](/images/algdg/2_fft2.png)

**Interpolation**   
$$\langle \text{values} \rangle = FFT(\langle \text{coefficients} \rangle, \omega)$$, and   
$$\langle \text{coefficients} \rangle = \frac 1 n FFT(\langle \text{values} \rangle, \omega^{-1}) $$


Details left,, See *Fourier basis*

**A closer look at the fast Fourier Transform**   
The FFT takes as input a vector $a = (a_0, ... a_{n-1})$ and a complex number $\omega$ whose powers are the complex root of unity.   
It multiplies this vector with the Matrix $M_n(\omega)$, which has $(j, k)_{th}$ entry (starting row and column count at zero) $\omega^{jk}$.
