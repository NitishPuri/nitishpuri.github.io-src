## Data Structures

### Dictionaries
![alt](/images/algdm/12_dict1.png)   

**Input Description :** A set of $n$ records, each identified by one or more fields.   
**Problem description :** Build and maintain a data structure to efficiently locate, insert, and delete the record associated with any query key $q$.   

* It is more important to avoid using a bad data structure than to identify the single best option available.   
* Questions to ask:
    * How many items will you have in your data structure?
    * Do you know the relative frequencies of insert, delete, and search operations?
    * Can we assume that the access pattern for keys will be uniform and random?
    *  Is it critical that individual operations be fast, or only that the total amount of work done over the entire program be minimized?
* Under the hood:
    * *Unsorted linked lists or arrays: For small data sets.*
    * *Sorted linked lists or arrays*
    * *Hash tables*
        * How do I deal with collisions? Open addressing or bucketing?
        * How big should the table be? At least as big as $m$, the number of items you expect to put in the table, it better be *prime*.
        * What hash functions should I choose?  For strings,    
        $$H(S,j) = \sum_{i=0}^{m-1}\alpha^{m-(i+1)}\times char(s_{i+j})\mod{m}$$
        $\alpha$ is the size of the alphabet, $char(x)$ maps a character to its ASCII code.
        This can be computer efficiently as,   
        $$H(S,j+1) = (H(S,j) - \alpha^{m-1}char(s_j))\alpha + s_{j+m}$$.
        In the end, make sure that the distribution is as *uniform* as possible.        
    * *Binary search trees*
        * Elegant data structures that support fast insertions, deletions and queries.
        * Do I need self balancing trees? *Red-black trees*, *splay trees*.
        * Use the best implementations!!
    * *B-trees*
        * For data sets so large that they will not fit in the memory.
        * Uses caches and secondary storage.
        * Look for *Cache-oblivious algorithms*
    * *Skip lists*
        * Somewhat of a cult data structure.
* **Implementations**
    * [C++ : `std::map`](http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/map/map/)
        * Implemented as *Binary Search Tree*.
    * LEDA
        * hashing, perfect hashing, B-trees, red-black trees, random search trees, skip lists.

### Priority Queues
![alt](/images/algdm/12_pqueue1.png)   


**Input description:** A set of records with numerically or otherwise totally-ordered keys.   
**Problem description:** Build and maintain a data structure for providing quick access to the smallest or largest key in the set.   

* Very useful in simulations(as future events ordered by time).
* Not required if insertions, deletions and queries are not intermixed.
* Questions to ask:
    * What other operations do you need?
    * Do you know the maximum data structure size in advance?
    * Might you change the priority of the elements already in the queue?
* Choices:
    * *Sorted array or list*
    * *Binary heaps*
    * *Bounded height priority queue*
        * Useful for small, discrete range of keys.
    * *Binary Search trees*
        * Very useful when you need more dictionary operations or the size is unbounded.
    * *Fibonacci and pairing heaps*
        * Speed up *decrease-key* operation.
* **Implementations**
    * [C++ STL `std::priority_queue`](http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/queue/priority_queue/)
        * Uses a `std::vector` or `std::dequeue`.
    * LEDA
        * Binary heaps, Fibonacci heaps, pairing heaps, Emde-Boas trees and bounded height priority queues
    * Java Collections : `java.util.PriorityQueue`

### Suffix Trees and Arrays
![alt](/images/algdm/12_suffix1.png)

**Input description:** A reference string $S$.   
**Problem description:** Build a data structure to quickly find all places where an arbitrary query string $q$ occurs in $S$.    

* Phenomenally useful for solving string problems.
* A *suffix tree* is simply a *trie* of all the proper suffixes of $S$.
* Can be constructed in $O(n)$ by making clever use of pointers!!
* What can you do with it?
    * Find all occurrences of $q$ as a substring of $S$ in $O(|q|+k)$, where $k$ is the number of occurrences.
    * Longest substring common to a set of strings.
    * Find the longest palindrome in $S$.
* They get even better when used as *suffix arrays*.
* **Implementations**
    * C implementation by *Schurmann and Stoye*.
    * Many C/C++ implementations in [*Pizza&Chili* corpus](http://pizzachili.di.unipi.it/)
    * Java
        * `BioJava::SuffixTree`

### Graph Data Structures
![alt](/images/algdm/12_graph1.png)   

**Input description:** A graph $G$.   
**Problem description:** Represent the graph $G$ using a flexible, efficient data structure.

* *Adjacency matrices* and *adjacency lists*.
* For *most* things, adjacency lists are the way to go, unless the graphs are very small or very dense.
* Questions to ask:
    * How big will your graph be?
    * How dense will your graph be?
    * Which algorithms will you be implementing?
    * Will you be modifying the graph over the course of your application?
* Prefer existing implementations.
* Graphs have different flavors, like *Planar graphs*, *Hypergraphs*, *hierarchical graphs*(representation). 
* **Implementation**
    * C++ : LEDA, Boost
    * Java : JUNG, Data Structures Library(JDSL), JGraphT
    * Stanford Graphbase

### Set data structures
![alt](/images/algdm/12_set1.png)

**Input description:** A universe of items $U = \{u_1, \ldots , u_n}\$ on which is defined a collection of subsets $S = \{S_1, \ldots , S_m\}$.   
**Problem description:** Represent each subset so as to efficiently $(1)$ test whether $u_i \in S_j$, $(2)$ compute the union or intersection of $S_i$ and $S_j$, and $(3)$ insert or delete members of $S$.   

* In mathematical terms, unordered collection of objects drawn from a fixed universal set.
* Uses a single *canonical order* for implementations, typically sorted.
* Distinguished from dictionaries(no fixed universal set) and strings(order is important).
* *Multisets* : An element can occur more than once.
* A system of subsets can also be represented as a *hypergraph*.
* Representations:
    * *Bit vectors* : For a fixed universal set. Space efficient, fast intersection and union. Not very good for sparse subsets.
    * *Containers and dictionaries*
    * *Bloom filters* : Bit vectors with hashing.
* *Set partition* : When an item can be in only one set.
* Representations for *set partition* structures:
    * *Collection of containers* : Membership testing is costly.
    * *Generalized bit vector* : Union, intersection takes $O(n),\; n = |U|$.
    * *Dictionary with a subset attribute* : : Union, intersection are slow.
    * *Union-find data structures* : Awesome asymptotic performance!!! Even better with *path compression*. Does not allow breaking subsets created by unions.
* **Implementations**
    * C++ STL `set` and `multiset`. LEDA.
    * Java Collections `HashSet` and `TreeSet`
* *Related :* [Generating subsets]({filename}algorithms-design-manual4.md#generating-subsets), [generating partitions]({filename}algorithms-design-manual4.md#generating-partitions), [set cover]({filename}algorithms-design-manual8.md#set-cover), [minimum spanning tree]({filename}algorithms-design-manual5.md#minimum-spanning-tree).

### Kd-Trees
![alt](/images/algdm/12_kdtree1.png)   

**Input description:** A set $S$ of $n$ points or more complicated geometric objects in $k$ dimensions.   
**Problem description:** Construct a tree that partitions space by half-planes such that each object is contained in its own box-shaped region.   

* Spatial data structures that hierarchically decompose space into a small number of cells, each containing a few representatives from an input set of points.
* Flavors differ in how the splitting plane is selected:
    * Cycling through the dimensions
    * Cutting along the largest dimension
    * *Quadtrees* or *Octtrees* : Cutting (axes-parallel planes) simultaneously along all the dimensions.
    * *BSP-trees* : General(arbitrary) cutting planes to carve up cells. More complicated to work with.
    * *R-trees* : Objects are partitioned into (possibly overlapping) boxes.
* Advantages :
    * Point location.
    * Nearest neighbor search.
    * Range search
    * Partial key search
* Effective upto say `20` dimensions.
* **Implementations**
