## Set and String Problems

### Set Cover
![alt](/images/algdm/18_setcover.png)   

**Input description:** A collection of subsets $S = {S_1, \ldots , S_m}$ of the universal set
$U = {1, \ldots , n}$.   
**Problem description:** What is the smallest subset $T$ of $S$ whose union equals
the universal setâ€”i.e. , $ \cup_{i=1}^{|T|} T_i = U$?   

* Several variations of set problem,
    * *Are you allowed to cover elements more than once?* Distinction between set cover and set packing.
    * *Are your sets derived from the edges or vertices of a graph?* Can be modeled as *vertex cover* instead.
    * *Do your subsets contain only two elements each?* You are in luck. Becomes NP-complete with three variables.
    * *Do you want to cover elements with sets, or sets with elements* 
* Greedy is the most natural and effective heuristic for set cover.
* Simulated annealing is likely to produce somewhat better set covers.
* Backtracking can be used to guarantee an optimal solution, but is computationally very expensive.
* Alternative, integer programming formulation of set cover.

### Set Packing

**Input description:** A set of subsets $S = {S_1, \ldots , S_m}$ of the universal set $U =
{1, \ldots , n}$.     
**Problem description:** Select (an ideally small) collection of mutually disjoint subsets from $S$ whose union is the universal set.    

* *Must every element appear in exactly one selected subset?* This will be NP-complete is yes.
* *Does each element have its own singleton set?* 
* *What is the penalty for covering elements twice?*
* The same heuristics as in set cover work here.
* *Related* : [Independent set]({filename}algorithms-design-manual6.md#independent-set), [set cover](#set-cover)

### String Matching
![alt](/images/algdm/18_stringmatching.png)   

**Input description:** A text string $t$ of length $n$. A pattern string $p$ of length $m$.     
**Problem description:** Find the first (or all) instances of pattern $p$ in the text.   

* Arises in almost all text-processing applications.
* Issues to look for,
    * *Are your search patterns and/or texts short?* Simple $O(mn)$ would suffice.
    * *What about longer texts and patterns?* Preprocessing the search pattern can help improve the *jumps* on finding a mismatch.
    * *Do I expect to find the pattern or not?* Check backwards and perform better jumps.
    * *Will you perform multiple queries on the same text?* Use suffix trees or suffix arrays.
    * *Will you search many texts using the same patterns?* Build finite automaton. Also useful when searching for regular expressions.
    * *What if our text or pattern contains a spelling error?* Use *Approximate string matching* algorithms.
* **Implementations** : Strmat, grep and variants, Boost string algorithms.
* *Related* : [Suffix trees]({filename}algorithms-design-manual2.md#suffix-trees-and-arrays), [approximate string matching](#approximate-string-matching)

### Approximate String Matching
![alt](/images/algdm/18_appmatch.png)   

**Input description:** A text string $t$ and a pattern string $p$.    
**Problem description:** What is the minimum-cost way to transform $t$ to $p$ using insertions, deletions, and substitutions?     

* A fundamental problem because we live in an error-prone world.
* Dynamic programming provides the basic approach. $D[i,j]$ = cost of editing $i$ characters of string $p$ into first $j$ characters of text $t$. The recurrence selected the minimum of,
    * if $p_i = t_j$ then $D[i-1, j-1]$ else $D[i-1, j-1] +$ substitution cost.
    * $D[i-1, j] +$ deletion cost of $p_j$.
    * $D[i, j+1] +$ deletion cost of $t_j$.
* Several issues remain however,
    * *Do I match the pattern against the full text, or against a substring?* 
    * *How should I select the substitution and insertion/deletion costs?* 
    * *How do I find the actual alignment of the strings?*
    * *What if the two strings are very similar to each other?* 
    * *Is your pattern short or long?* You can use bit-parallel algorithms, which can be many times faster than dynamic programming.
    * *How can I minimize the required storage?* Quadratic space required by dp table is only required if you need to reconstruct the actual sequence alignment.
    * *Should I score long runs of indels differently?* 
    * *Does similarity mean strings that sound alike?*
* **Implementations** : agrep, nrgrep, TRE

### Text Compression
![alt](/images/algdm/18_textcomp.png)   

**Input description:** A text string $S$.   
**Problem description:** Create a shorter text string $S'$ such that $S$ can be correctly reconstructed from $S'$.   

* Decreasing secondary storage prices seem to have increased interest in data compression, because there is more data to compress.
* Several questions arise while selecting the right compression algorithm,
    * *Must we recover the exact input text after compression?* Lossy vs Lossless encoding. Documents can't use lossy compression. Images/videos can.
    * *Can I simplify my data before I compress it?* Any information that can be removed would help in compression later.
    * *Does it matter whether the algorithm is patented?* Just something to look out for.
    * *How do I compress image data?* Use JPEG.
    * *Must compression run in real time?* Depends on the application.
* Several dozen algorithms are available,
    * *Huffman codes*, greedy variable length encoding based on frequency.
    * *Lempel-ziv algorithms* (LZV compression), just use this.
* **Implementations** : *gzip*, *bzip2*

### Cryptography
![alt](/images/algdm/18_crypto.png)   


**Input description:** A plaintext message $T$ or encrypted text $E$, and a key $k$.    
**Problem description:** Encode $T$ (decode $E$) using $k$ giving $E$ ($T$).    


* Foundation for the modern internet.
* Three classes of cryptosystems everyone should be aware of,
    * *Ceaser shifts*, substitute on character for something else. Easy to break using statistical analysis.
    * *Block shuffle ciphers*, DES(now *crackable*), AES, Triple DES.
    * *Public key cryptography*, RSA 
* *Never* try to roll out your own novel cryptosystem. It is *not* going to work.
* Certain problems related to cryptography,
    * *How can I validate the integrity of data against random corruption?* use checksums, cyclic redundancy check.
    * *How can I validate the integrity of data against deliberate corruption?* MD5, SHA-256.
    * *How can I prove that a file has not been changed?* Digital signatures.
    * *How can I restrict access to copyrighted material?* Stream ciphers are used, but are needed to be protected by the law.
* **Implementations** : Nettle, Crypto++

### Finite State Machine Minimization
![alt](/images/algdm/18_fsm.png)   

**Input description:** A deterministic finite automaton $M$.    
**Problem description:** Create the smallest deterministic finite automaton $M'$ such that $M'$ behaves identically to $M$.    

* Useful in control systems, compilers, software and hardware design.
* Minimizing the state machine can reduce both storage and execution costs.
* Consider three different problems,    
    * *Minimizing deterministic finite state machine*, be removing redundancy.
    * *Constructing deterministic machines from nondeterministic machines*, this can however be worse than NP-complete, as the number of states blow up exponentially.
    * *Constructing machines from regular expressions*, can construct either NFA or DFA.

### Longest Common Substring/Subsequence
![alt](/images/algdm/18_lcsm.png)   

**Input description:** A set $S$ of strings $S_1, \ldots , Sn$.     
**Problem description:** What is the longest string $S'$ such that all the characters
of $S'$ appear as a substring or subsequence of each $S_i, 1 \le i \le n$?   

* Arises when finding similarity among multiple sequences.
* Issues arising include,
    * *Are you looking for a common substring?*
    * *Are you looking for a common scattered subsequence?*
    * *What if there are relatively few sets of matching characters?*
    * *What if the strings are permutations?*
    * *What if we have more than two strings to align?*

### Shortest Common Superstring
![alt](/images/algdm/18_scs.png)   

**Input description:** A set of strings $S = {S_1, \ldots , S_m}$.    
**Problem description:** Find the shortest string $S'$ that contains each string $S_i$ as
a substring of $S'$.    

* This can be useful in data compression, DNA sequence assembly.
* Finding a super-sequence is not a problem, but finding the *shortest* super-sequence is NP-complete.
* Easily reducible to asymmetric TSP problem.
* A greedy heuristic: find the substrings with maximum overlap and merge them, repeat.
