## Combinatorial Problems

*Check out [Numerical Recipes](http://numerical.recipes/)*

Whats different?   

* Issues of Precision and Error. Floating point issues. Use both single and double precision, and think hard when they diverge.
* Extensive Libraries of Code. There is no reason to not to use all thats already written.


### Sorting
![alt](/images/algdm/14_sorting.png)   

**Input description:** A set of $n$ items.    
**Problem description:** Arrange the items in increasing (or decreasing) order.   

* The most fundamental algorithmic problem in computer science.
* First rule of algorithm design : *"when in doubt, sort"* 
* Questions to ask,
    * How many keys will you be sorting? Use simple routines.
    * Will there be duplicate keys in the data? Do you need sort to be stable?
    * What do you know about your data? 
        * Has the data already been partially sorted? *Insertion sort* would perform much better.
        * Do you know the distribution of the keys? A *bucket* or *distribution sort* would make sense.
        * Are your keys very long or hard to compare? It might make sense to use prefixes, or maybe use *radix* sort.
        * Is the range of possible keys very small? Use something like counting sort.
    * Do I have to worry about disk accesses? Use *external sorting*, or use *B-tree*.
    * How much time do you have to write and debug your routine?
* If you want to implement your own *quicksort*,
    * Use randomization,
    * Median of three
    * Leave small subarrays for insertion sort
    * Do the smaller partition first. compiler optimizations using *tail recursion* might help.
* **Implementations** : GNU sort, C++ STL `sort` and `stable_sort`, and many more.
* *Related* : [Dictionaries](), [searching](#searching), [topological sorting]()

### Searching
![alt](/images/algdm/14_searching.png)   

**Input description:** A set of $n$ keys $S$, and a query key $q$.   
**Problem description:** Where is $q$ in $S$?   

* "Searching" is a word that means different things to different people.
* We consider the task of searching for a key in a list, array or a tree.
* Sequential search *vs.* Binary search.
* Questions to ask,
    * How much time can you spend programming? *Binary search* can be tricky to be made bug free.
    * Are certain items accessed more often than other ones? Exploit there relative frequencies.
    * Might access frequencies change over time? Use self-organizing structures like *splay trees*.
    * Is the key close by? Use *sequential* search.
    * Is my data structure sitting on external memory? Use *B-trees*.
    * Can I guess where the key should be? *Interpolation search*
* **Implementations** : C++ STL `find` and `binary_search`
* *Related* : [Dictionaries](), [sorting](#sorting)

### Median and Selection
![alt](/images/algdm/14_median.png)   

**Input description:** A set of $n$ numbers or keys, and an integer $k$.   
**Problem description:** Find the key smaller than exactly $k$ of the $n$ keys.

* *Median* finding is an essential problem in statistics, more robust than *mean*.
* Special case of *selection* problem which arises in several applications,
    * Filtering outlying elements : Remove 10% largest and smallest values.
    * Identifying the most promising candidates : Select top 25%.
    * Deciles and related divisions.
    * Order statistics
* Issues in median finding(arbitrary selection),
    * How fast does it have to be? $O(n\log n)$ or $O(n)$ *expected*-time.
    * What if you only get to see each element once? Define approximate deciles, or do random sampling, or mix both strategies.
    * How fast can you find the mode?
* **Implementations** : C++ STL `nth_element`
* *Related* : [Priority queues](), [sorting](#sorting)


### Generating Permutations
![alt](/images/algdm/14_permute.png)   

**Input description:** An integer $n$.   
**Problem description:** Generate (1) all, or (2) a random, or (3) the next permutation of length $n$.   

* Many algorithmic problems require seek the best way to order a set of objects, like *travelling salesman*, *bandwidth*, *graph isomorphism*.
* A fundamental notion of order is required.
* Two different paradigms : ranking/unranking and incremental change methods.
* Define functions Rank/Unrank such that,  $p = Unrank(Rank(p), n)$.
    * Sequencing permutations
    * Generating random permutations
    * Keep track of a set of permutations.
* Incremental change algorithms can be tricky, but concise.
* We can also save time by avoiding identical permutations if there are duplicate elements.
* **Implementations** : C++ STL `next_permutation` and `prev_permutation`.
* *Related* : [Random-number generation](), [generating subsets](#generating-subsets), [generating partitions](#generating-partitions).

### Generating Subsets
![alt](/images/algdm/14_subsets.png)   

**Input description:** An integer $n$.   
**Problem description:** Generate (1) all, or (2) a random, or (3) the next subset of the integers $\{1, \cdots , n\}$.   

* Here, the order among the elements does not matter.
* Many algorithmic problems seek the best subset : *vertex cover*, *knapsack*, *set packing*.
* There are $2^n$ different subsets of an $n$-element set. This is much less than the $n!$ permutations.
* It is a good idea to keep elements in subset sorted in a *canonical* order so as to speed up identity testing.
* Options,
    * Lexicographic order : surprisingly difficult to generate.
    * Gray Code : Adjacent subsets differ by insertion/deletion of only one element.
    * Binary counting : Use a bit-vector.
* Useful in,
    * K-subsets All subsets of length K.
    * Strings

### Generating Partitions
![alt](/images/algdm/14_partition.png)   

**Input description:** An integer $n$.   
**Problem description:** Generate (1) all, or (2) a random, or (3) the next integer or set partitions of length $n$.

* *Integer partitions* are multisets of nonzero integers that add up exactly to $n$. Use in for eg. *nuclear fision*..
* *Set partitions* divide the elements $1, \ldots, n$ into nonempty subsets. Use in for eg. *vertex/edge coloring* and *connected components*.
* *Related* : [Generating permutations](#generating-permutations), [generating subsets](#generating-subsets).

### Generating Graphs
![alt](/images/algdm/14_graphs.png)   

**Input description:** Parameters describing the desired graph, including the number of vertices $n$, and the number of edges $m$ or edge probability $p$.   
**Problem description:** Generate (1) all, or (2) a random, or (3) the next graph satisfying the parameters.   


* Useful for generating test data for programs.
* A different application arises in network design. Adding redundancy and tolerance to vertex failures. 
* Questions to ask,
    * Do I want labeled or unlabeled graphs?
    * Do I want directed or undirected graphs? 
* How do you want to model randomness?
    * Random edge generation
    * Random edge selection
    * Preferential attachment
* Alternatively, we can generate *organic* graphs that can reflect relationships among real-world objects.
* Other interesting graphs,
    * Trees
    * Fixed degree sequence graphs
* **Implementations** : Stanford GraphBase, Combinatorica, and more resources.
* *Related* : [Generating permutations](#generating-permutations), [graph isomorphism]()

### Calendrical Calculations
![alt](/images/algdm/14_calcal.png)   

**Input description:** A particular calendar date $d$, specified by month, day, and year.   
**Problem description:** Which day of the week did $d$ fall on according to the given calendar system?   

* Important in business applications. More important for international applications dealing with different timezones and possibly different calender systems.
* Complications arise with irregularity in years duration(leap years).
* So it becomes pointless to implement them by hand.
* **Implementations** : C++ Boost `datetime`.
* *Related* : [Arbitrary precision arithmetic](), [generating permutations](#generating-permutations)


### Job Scheduling
![alt](/images/algdm/14_jobschedule.png)   

**Input description:** A directed acyclic graph $G = (V,E)$, where vertices represent jobs and edge $(u,v)$ implies that task $u$ must be completed before task $v$.   
**Problem description:** What schedule of tasks completes the job using the minimum amount of time or processors?    

* Devising a proper schedule to satisfy a set of constraints is fundamental to many applications.
* Mapping tasks to processors is a critical aspect of any parallel-processing system. 
* Applications
    * Topological sorting : precedence constraints.
    * Bipartite matching : skill matching
    * Vertex and edge coloring : avoid interference.
    * Travelling salesman 
    * Eulerian Cycle
 * Interesting problems,
    * Critical path
    * Minimum completion time
    * What is the tradeoff between the number of workers and completion time?
* Can also be modeled using Integer-linear programming.
* More variations,
    * Assign jobs to identical machines to minimize the the total elapsed time.
    * Tasks are provided with allowable start and required finish times.
* **Implementations** : JOBSHOP (C), Tablix, LEKIN and more.
* *Related* : [Topological sorting](), [matching](), [vertex coloring](), [edge coloring](), [bin packing]()   


### Satisfiability
![alt](/images/algdm/14_sat.png)   


**Input description:** A set of clauses in conjunctive normal form.   
**Problem description:** Is there a truth assignment to the Boolean variables such that every clause is simultaneously satisfied?   

* A primary application of testing hardware/software design on all the inputs.
* *The* original NP-complete problem.
* Issues,
    * Is your formula the `AND` of `OR`s (CNF) or the `OR` of `AND`s (DNF)? DNF can be solved easily, while CNF is NP-complete. We can use *De Morgan's laws* to convert CNF into DNF. However the translation itself could take exponential time.
    * How big are your clauses? 3-SAT and above are NP-complete.
    * Does it suffice to satisfy most of the clauses? This can make the problem *easier*.
